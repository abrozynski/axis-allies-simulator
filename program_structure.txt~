Here's where I keep track of inheretence for my feeble brain

army - inherets NOTHING. GOOD DAY SIR.

nation - nothing

installation - nothing

battle <- army

territory <- army, installation

militaryOrganization <- army, territory

map <- army, territory (this should be mashed up into game)

europe1940 <- territory, nation, army, installation, militaryOrganization
