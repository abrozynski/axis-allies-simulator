Here's where I keep track of inheretence for my feeble brain

army - inherets NOTHING. GOOD DAY SIR.

nation - nothing

installation - nothing

battle <- army (change this to nothing)

territory <- army, installation

militaryOrganization <- nothing

europe1940 <- territory, nation, militaryOrganization

game <- europe1940
